Overview
I am pleased to share one of the software development projects that challenged and motivated me the most. I designed and developed a Windows Forms application in C# focused on the registration and management of personal information. This application offers robust features for registering, editing, deleting, and listing registered individuals.

Features
The application includes a variety of essential features:

People Registration
Allows detailed information about a person to be registered, covering fields such as name, date of birth, marital status, phone number, homeownership, gender, and vehicle ownership.

Information Editing
Users can edit details of previously registered individuals. Simply double-clicking on the name in the list automatically populates the fields in the interface, making edits straightforward and effective.

People Deletion
Facilitates the removal of people's records from the list of registered individuals. The deletion action is performed by selecting a person in the list and clicking the "Delete" button.

Clear Fields
For a more convenient experience, the "Clear Fields" feature allows the quick removal of all data currently entered in the interface's fields. This prepares the interface for the input of new data.

People Listing
The "List People" feature provides an overview of the individuals registered in the application. The names of the registered individuals are displayed in the list in the interface, making it easy to check existing records.
